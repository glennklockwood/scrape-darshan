================================================================================

This is a simple tool that wraps `darshan-parser` in goroutines with the intent
of parallelizing the analysis of large repositories of Darshan log files.

- `input.darshan/` contains some sample input in Darshan 3.x format
- `input.txt/` contains sample input that was generated by `darshan-parser` on
  the logs contained in `input.darshan/`

The initial naive implementation uses gross amounts of memory (e.g., a resident
set size of 488 MiB on a 4.3 MiB input) and it isn't clear why.  Thus this is a
work in progress.
